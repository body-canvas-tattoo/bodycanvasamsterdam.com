    <p>Before getting a tattoo, we will inform you of the risks and how we follow the health and hygiene regulations to protect you (and us) from these. We will also recommend how you should take care of your tattoo to protect yourself as your tattoo heals.</p>

    <p>We will ask for your name, birthdate, address, and ID to prove you are over 16 years old.</p>
    <p>We will ask you to sign a consent form, according to the GGD (Medical and Health Service Amsterdam) to declare the following:</p>
