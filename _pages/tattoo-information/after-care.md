Skin breaks during tattooing, resulting in a wound. If you take care of the tattoo,  it heals in about 6 weeks. If the tattoo is covered with a sterile compress or a household foil, you can remove this after 3 to 5 hours. You can shower with a tattoo.

Treat the uncovered tattoo injury as follows:
* wash the tattoo twice a day with mild unscented soap;
* pat the tattoo dry with a clean towel after washing;
* coat the wound with a specific aftercare ointment;


During the healing process, make sure that you:
* touch the tattoo as little as possible (wash hands before  caring for the wound);
* do not scratch the tattoo;
* do not cover with tight or dirty clothing;
* do not cover with bandages or bandages;
avoid (bubble) baths, swimming pools, saunas, and steam baths;
* do not expose the tattoo to sunlight or a tanning bed.
even after it’s healed, it’s sensitive to sunlight so always cover with sunscreen.

Important: Contact a doctor in case of extreme redness, swelling, bleeding, fluid, color change or chronic pain.
