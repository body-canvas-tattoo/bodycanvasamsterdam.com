  <p>Skin breaks during tattooing, resulting in a wound. If you take care of the tattoo,  it heals in about 6 weeks. If the tattoo is covered with a sterile compress or a household foil, you can remove this after 3 to 5 hours. You can shower with a tattoo.</p>

  <p>Treat the uncovered tattoo injury as follows: </p>
  <ul class="text-left">
    <li>wash the tattoo twice a day with mild unscented soap;</li>
    <li>pat the tattoo dry with a clean towel after washing;</li>
    <li>coat the wound with a specific aftercare ointment;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>During the healing process, make sure that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>touch the tattoo as little as possible (wash hands before  caring for the wound);</li>
    <li>do not scratch the tattoo;</li>
    <li>do not cover with tight or dirty clothing;</li>
    <li>do not cover with bandages or bandages;</li>
    <li>avoid (bubble) baths, swimming pools, saunas, and steam baths;</li>
    <li>do not expose the tattoo to sunlight or a tanning bed.</li>
    <li>even after it’s healed, it’s sensitive to sunlight so always cover with sunscreen.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Important: Contact a doctor in case of extreme redness, swelling, bleeding, fluid, color change or chronic pain.</p>
